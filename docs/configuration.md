# Configuration

Pi Fabric reads configuration from two JSON files. Project values override global values.

1. `~/.pi/agent/fabric.json`: global defaults.
2. `<project>/.pi/fabric.json`: project overrides, only for **trusted** projects.

`/fabric settings` opens at project scope in trusted projects and at global scope in untrusted sessions. In a trusted project, press **Ctrl+G** anywhere in the settings view to move both the displayed values and the save destination between `<project>/.pi/fabric.json` and the global `~/.pi/agent/fabric.json`. The global view shows global defaults even when a project override stays effective in the current session, and the scope banner marks that precedence. Untrusted sessions remain global-only.

`configVersion` versions each configuration document. Fabric migrates each applicable file independently before it applies global/project precedence, then rewrites migrated files atomically. Version 0, the historical unversioned format, renames `subagents` to `agents`. When both sections exist, `agents` wins conflicts and non-conflicting values survive. Fabric migrates trusted project files, and it never reads or rewrites untrusted project files. Add future schema changes as sequential migrations. Avoid runtime aliases.

`executor.runtime` selects `"quickjs"` (the default isolated WASM runtime) or `"node-process"` (a disposable native V8 process). QuickJS memory limits stop at `4294967295` bytes, because its WASM32 `size_t` cannot represent 4 GiB. Fabric rejects larger values. It never wraps them. Node process limits can reach the detected physical memory, and Fabric passes them to V8 as `--max-old-space-size`.

Treat `node-process` as an explicit escape hatch for trusted code. It offers no security sandbox. The runtime keeps Fabric's IPC host bridge, approvals, audit records, timeout, and cancellation in place. Node's `vm` API provides no security boundary. Enable it only for workloads and projects whose generated code you accept running with the local user account's authority. Each invocation starts a fresh child process, and Fabric forcibly terminates that process when it settles, times out, or is cancelled. Schema enforce mode always forces `quickjs`. Large limits in either runtime can exhaust system memory or destabilize the machine.

## Components

`components` is a root array of declarative supervised instances. Each `id` gives one instance a stable identity, and `component` names its definition in the versioned protocol. Fabric passes `config` to `activate(context, config)`. The `disabled` field removes an instance from the active graph and preserves its declaration. An empty array is the default, with a limit of 256 valid entries. The runtime installs enabled first-party providers as pinned `fabric.provider.*` components whose reserved IDs sit outside this array.

Unknown definitions stay visible as waiting. They do not fail the Fabric runtime. Late discovery activates them. `/fabric reload` reconciles entry changes as a transaction. When a definition re-registers with `overwrite: true`, Fabric uses the same rollback-capable replacement path. See [components, effects, and committed capabilities](components.md).

## Prewalk executor

`prewalk.model` is the optional Pi `provider/model` that `/fabric prewalk` selects. `prewalk.mode` chooses how execution continues:

- `"in-place"` (default) switches Main to the executor model, queues a hidden follow-up in the same session, and restores Main's boundary model when the continuation settles.
- `"trajectory"` forks the finalized outer Fabric call and result to a visible Pi child, then waits for it. After the child finishes, a hidden continuation asks Main to verify the work and report its findings.

```json
{
  "prewalk": {
    "mode": "in-place",
    "model": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5",
    "thinking": "high",
    "alwaysRearm": true,
    "compactOnReturn": true
  }
}
```

`prewalk.thinking` sets the optional reasoning effort for the trajectory child executor. Its values are `off` / `minimal` / `low` / `medium` / `high` / `xhigh` / `max`, clamped to each model's supported levels. When you leave it unset, the executor inherits `agents.thinking`. In-place mode keeps Main's session level.

`prewalk.alwaysRearm` defaults to `false`. When enabled, prewalk returns to an armed, taskless state after each completed handoff (in-place return or trajectory completion). Every session then starts armed automatically, non-interactively from `prewalk.model`, and `/fabric reload` re-arms as well. `/fabric prewalk --off` cancels the armed state until the next session start or reload. Turns that settle without a handoff never disarm prewalk, regardless of this setting. The settings UI labels an unset model **Ask each time**. Non-interactive sessions must configure a model. In-place mode does not require child agents. Trajectory mode requires `agents.enabled`. It shows child spawn, progress, nested tools, metrics, and completion in Main's Fabric activity UI.

`prewalk.detectShellWrites` defaults to `true`. When armed, a `fabric_exec` boundary that ran a successful `pi.bash` without an audited `pi.edit` / `pi.write` / `schema.commit` claims the handoff if file size or mtime stats drifted from the arm-time baseline. This routes shell heredocs and formatter binaries to the executor as well. The report's `trigger.files` lists the bounded drifted paths. Set it to `false` to accept audited mutations only.

`prewalk.compactOnReturn` defaults to `true`. When an in-place continuation settles, Fabric requests a compaction with the configured `compaction.engine` and commits it while the executor is still the active model. Main's restored model receives the compacted transcript. Set this option to `false` when Main must receive the complete transcript.

Each in-place handoff captures Main's active model at the boundary and restores it when the continuation settles. Pi's public `setModel` extension API also updates Pi's default model setting, so the restore returns the configured default to Main's model as well. A session that ends mid-continuation keeps the executor selection persisted until the next settle.

## Result formatting

`executor.resultFormat` sets the default for `fabric_exec` return values. Find it under `/fabric settings` → **Executor**. `"auto"` keeps strings as text and renders structured values as syntax-highlighted YAML. `"yaml"`, `"json"`, and `"text"` each force their named behavior. A call-level `resultFormat` parameter overrides the configured default.

Configure the compaction engine under `/fabric settings` → **Compaction**. Select `"fabric"` for deterministic compaction, or `"pi"` to hand compaction to Pi core.

## Code modes

In the default full code mode, `fabric_exec` owns Pi core tool execution. The parent model sees one programmable tool. The direct `read`, `bash`, `edit`, `write`, `grep`, `find`, and `ls` schemas stay hidden. Fabric programs reach those capabilities through `pi.*`:

```ts
const files = await pi.find({ pattern: "**/*.ts", path: "src" });
const matches = await pi.grep({ pattern: "TODO", path: "src" });
return { files, matches };
```

Run independent calls in parallel:

```ts
const [packageJson, readme] = await Promise.all([
  pi.read({ path: "package.json" }),
  pi.read({ path: "README.md" }),
]);
return {
  package: JSON.parse(packageJson).name,
  readmeLines: readme.split("\n").length,
};
```

Pi core calls reject when the native tool reports an error. Successful `bash`, `edit`, and `write` calls return the `{ ok: true, output, details }` shape. Catch a rejection when recovery is local. `bash` rejects on an ordinary nonzero exit. Pass `settle: true` (for example `pi.bash({ command, settle: true })`) to receive `{ ok: false, output, details: null, exitCode, error }` on a nonzero exit. Timeout, cancellation, approval, security, and spawn failures still reject.

### Full code mode (default)

`fullCodeMode: true` is the default. Fabric removes the active Pi core tools from the parent model and exposes their implementations only inside `fabric_exec` through `pi.*`. Fabric also captures registered overrides such as security gates and code previews, so `pi.read()` keeps routing through the override.

Fabric records which native core tools were active before it takes ownership. Switching to orchestration-only mode or unloading Fabric restores that selection. Fabric applies full-mode ownership only when the session initializes or the mode changes. It never resets an explicitly selected active tool set from input, agent-start, turn-end, or settled lifecycle hooks. The system prompt carries the full-mode execution rule.

Pi core shows its model-visible skill catalog only while the native `read` tool is active. Full code mode restores the same catalog from Pi's structured skill registry and changes only the loader instruction, so `pi.read` runs inside `fabric_exec`. Native core tools stay hidden. Packaged skills mark cross-document paths with `<skill-dir>`. Fabric replaces that marker inline from Pi's expanded skill `location` or the actual `SKILL.md` read path. It never matches skill names or enumerates directories. Ordinary document reads stay unchanged. When an expanded skill invokes another installed skill, Fabric adds an exact name-to-path resolution hint for that turn, and the delegated `SKILL.md` loads before task work.

### Orchestration-only mode

Some users want Fabric for MCP, agents, ambient actors, parallel workflows, councils, and recursive delegation while Pi's core tools remain fully native. Those users can opt out of full code mode:

```json
{
  "fullCodeMode": false
}
```

In orchestration-only mode:

- Pi's `read`, `bash`, `edit`, `write`, `grep`, `find`, and `ls` tools stay on Pi's normal model-facing and execution paths. Fabric applies the configured risk approval policy through Pi's native `tool_call` preflight, and it leaves their execution and rendering untouched.
- Registered extension tools also remain in Pi's native registry. Fabric does not hide, wrap, or expose them through `extensions.*`. Model-requested direct calls use exact `capture.risks` overrides or the conservative `capture.defaultRisk` approval class.
- `pi.*`, `extensions.*`, and equivalent `tools.call()` references are unavailable inside `fabric_exec`, even when TypeScript checks are bypassed.
- MCP and stable Fabric providers remain available through `mcp.*`, `memory.*`, `state.*`, `schema.*`, `components.*`, and `compact.*`. Generic discovery and computed refs still work through `tools.*`. One-shot and recursive agents, persistent ambient actors, dynamic workflows, mesh coordination, councils, explicit Fabric providers, and the Fabric TUI keep their full behavior.
- Child agents continue using their allowed Pi tools directly, so parallel and ambient setups never route their coding operations back through Fabric code mode.

### Where to set `fullCodeMode`

`fullCodeMode` defaults to `true`. Set the flag in `.pi/fabric.json` for one project, or globally in `~/.pi/agent/fabric.json` for every project. `/fabric settings` toggles it as well.

## Captured extension tools

When `fullCodeMode` is enabled, Fabric intercepts Pi's `ExtensionRunner.getAllRegisteredTools()` registry chokepoint. This captures tools that other extensions register at startup or later through `pi.registerTool()`. Whether an extension loads before or after Fabric makes no difference.

Captured custom tools leave the model's active tool set by default. Their schemas, snippets, and guidelines stop consuming the parent model context, and the model reaches them only through `fabric_exec`. The tools stay **registered** in Pi's runtime, so `pi.getAllTools()` keeps listing them. Host extensions that gate or audit tool calls by name (for example `@gotgenes/pi-permission-system`, which blocks names missing from that list before its own rules run) still see them as registered, and they evaluate nested captured calls through their normal policy and prompts. The owning extension remains loaded: its commands, event handlers, state, and UI continue to work. Only model-facing exposure and invocation become lazy.

```ts
const matches = await tools.search({ query: "deployment status" });
const schema = await tools.describe({ ref: matches[0].ref });
const result = await tools.call({
  ref: schema.ref,
  args: { environment: "staging" },
});
return result;
```

For tool names valid as JavaScript properties, use the shorter proxy:

```ts
const result = await extensions.project_status({ verbose: true });
return result.text;
```

The result keeps `content`, exposes text content as `text`, and carries `details`, `isError`, `terminate`, and source provenance. Fabric runs the captured definition's `prepareArguments()` and original executor with its owning extension context. Pi's `tool_call`, `tool_result`, and `tool_execution_*` lifecycle handlers also apply to nested captured calls.

In full code mode, Fabric captures and hides extension overrides of core tools together with their built-in counterparts. Inside Fabric, `pi.read`, `pi.bash`, and the other built-ins route through a captured override when one exists. `extensions.read` exposes the override's full native result shape. `capture.keepVisible` can re-activate non-core extension tools, so the model may also call them directly on Pi's native path. Core tool names stay excluded as long as full code mode owns them.

A compatible exact-name core override is an additive extension of its existing `pi.<name>` slot. In effective full-code execution (including Schema enforce mode, which treats execution as full-code even when `fullCodeMode` is false), the current override schema contributes a bounded, schema-derived object overload without replacing Fabric's built-in positional, bare-string, shorthand, or alias forms. Fabric keeps each slot's established normalized result contract (`string` for read-like tools and `{ ok, output, details }` for bash/edit/write). The registry still validates the normalized arguments authoritatively; Fabric does not prove that an override schema is a superset of the built-in schema. Schema enforce mode still applies its host gate: read-like core refs remain available, while protected mutations and external effects are blocked or must use the schema transaction path. An override's `promptSnippet` and `promptGuidelines`, when present, are appended as guidance for the corresponding `pi.<name>` identity and are not advertised as a second extension tool. Registration, replacement, reload, and removal are observed on the next execution and prompt build; no generated declaration or prompt state is persisted.

## Approvals and risk

Fabric risk classes are `read`, `write`, `execute`, `network`, and `agent`. Approval policy values are `allow`, `ask`, `auto`, or `deny`. Policies cover actions invoked inside `fabric_exec` and top-level model-requested tools left on Pi's native path. Native calls keep Pi's original implementation, result shape, and renderer. Fabric adds only the supported interception hook that runs before execution.

- Captured and directly registered tools default to the conservative `execute` risk because Pi tool definitions do not declare effects. Add exact tool-name overrides under `capture.risks`. Fovea's verified graph-navigation tools (`fovea_sketch`, `fovea_focus`, `fovea_dwell`, and `fovea_impact`) are read-only exceptions that default to `read`.
- Set `capture.hideFromModel` to `false` to index non-core extension tools without hiding them from the model's active set.
- Names in `capture.keepVisible` stay in the model-facing active set of both Fabric and Pi. Pi core names are the exception: they remain Fabric-owned in full code mode.
- `capture.advisory` injects a capability hint at `before_agent_start` when the prompt's terms match a captured source's tf-idf fingerprint (names and descriptions grouped by source namespace, with no manifest declarations needed). `mode: "enabled"` (the default) renders the hint in the transcript. `"hidden"` delivers the hint to the model only. `"disabled"` turns it off. Each capability fires at most once per session. Fabric derives ash from the session transcript itself: a fired hint becomes its own custom-message entry, and organic use becomes its own tool call. Reloads and `/tree` branch rewinds replay ashes exactly up to the current point, and a brand-new session starts with a clean urn. `maxPerSession` (default 3) caps hints within a session. `threshold` (default 0.9) tunes sensitivity. `budget` (default 512, clamped 128 to 8192, the same range as [pi-fovea](https://github.com/monotykamary/pi-fovea)'s `sync.budget`) caps the advisory text in tokens, estimated as chars/4. Rendering walks a degradation ladder until one rung fits: one ▪ bullet per tool with descriptions, then names-only bullets, then one bullet per source, then `header + steer`. The ladder keeps leftover tools addressable in a `~ +N more in <source>` counter. The matcher follows a combustion model: 1/df-weighted term scoring. Strong matches fire instantly. Weak matches accumulate warmth ($W \leftarrow \frac{1}{2}W + \frac{1}{2}s$) and ignite at $W \geq$ threshold. Each namespace's fire-set is durable *ash*, either `fired` or `organic` (`organic` covers tools you used without a hint). Ignored fires push smoke streaks that raise the weak-band ignition point by $\theta/\tau^2$ per streak, $0.25\theta$ at the internal memory scale $\tau = 2$. Every internal constant projects from $\tau$ and the score quantum $q = 1$. See [capability-combustion.md](capability-combustion.md) for the full math. Fabric strips skill markup that pi expands into the prompt (`<available_skills>` / `<skill>` blocks) before matching, so a loaded skill cannot trigger its own hint. The hint follows fovea's icon/indent shape: a compact headline naming the matched sources, ▪ bullet rows for the refs, a `Next:` schema/action line for the top ref, and a `Steer:` directive.
- An `ask` policy emits a warning notification and opens an explicit **Allow once** / **Allow for this session** / **Deny** permission prompt. These options match Claude-style approval scopes. **Allow once** authorizes only the requested action. **Allow for this session** keeps that risk class authorized until the current Pi session ends. The TUI uses an inline wizard. RPC clients receive the equivalent `select` dialog.
- Fabric serializes concurrent requests so a one-time approval never silently widens to sibling calls. Session-wide grants apply to native calls and to `fabric_exec`. Escape, dismissal, unavailable interactive UI, and session restart all fail closed.

### Auto approval mode

An `auto` policy sends each validated call and its prepared arguments to a separate Pi model before invocation. Configure **Auto model** under `/fabric settings` → **Approvals**, or set the optional canonical `provider/model` key in `fabric.json`:

```json
{
  "approvals": {
    "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-4-6",
    "write": "auto",
    "execute": "auto",
    "network": "auto",
    "agent": "auto"
  }
}
```

Choose **Inherit** in the model picker to omit `approvals.model` and use the active Pi session model. Built-in and custom models dispatch through Pi's effective provider runtime, including providers with custom API identifiers. Older supported Pi versions fall back to their compatibility provider registry. Read access stays independently configurable, and most setups leave it at `allow`.

The classifier receives the exact action, bounded prepared arguments, cwd, user-message text, and assistant tool calls. Fabric excludes assistant prose and tool outputs, so model-authored reasoning and retrieved hostile content cannot directly instruct the classifier. The classifier has no executable tools and must return a structured `allow` or `escalate` verdict. An `allow` verdict applies only to that call. `escalate`, malformed output, missing authentication, timeout, cancellation, or any classifier error falls back to the explicit **Allow once** / **Allow for this session** / **Deny** prompt. Headless runs fail closed when that prompt cannot be shown. Fabric attaches classifier token usage and cost to the resulting `fabric_exec` or native tool result, and execution traces record each nested verdict as `fabric.approval.auto`.

`deny` stays deterministic and runs before the classifier. Schema enforcement, project trust, budgets, and other host gates remain authoritative. Auto mode is a model-based policy advisor and provides no stronger sandbox boundary. Its initial conservative policy escalates destructive or irreversible actions, shared/external/production changes, credential or sensitive-data exposure, safety bypasses, actions beyond explicit user intent, and actions whose safety is uncertain. Fabric adapts the policy architecture described in Claude Code's [permission modes](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permission-modes), [auto-mode configuration](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/auto-mode-config), and Anthropic's [auto-mode engineering write-up](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-auto-mode), adapted to Pi's model registry and Fabric's existing per-risk policy gate.

## Temporal retention

Fabric clears inactive run artifacts by age. It never truncates active JSONL files. The defaults are:

- `retention.orphanedTempRunMs`: remove a temporary run root six hours after its owner process dies. Active roots carry a heartbeat marker and are never removed.
- `retention.oneShotRunMs`: retain terminal one-shot agent run artifacts for 24 hours. An explicit `agents.cleanup()` may remove them sooner. On every other path, graceful shutdown marks their temporary root closed for temporal cleanup.
- `retention.actorRunArchiveMs`: retain terminal actor run archives for seven days. Fabric always preserves the latest run for each actor.

Cleanup runs during active Fabric sessions and when a new top-level run manager starts. It never truncates active run logs or actor `session.jsonl` files. `/fabric settings` exposes all three values under **Retention**. Changing them requires `/fabric reload`.

## Agents

`agents.runner` selects the default harness: `"pi"`, `"claude"`, or `"veda"`. `agents.model` is the optional Pi `provider/id` override. `agents.claude.model` is the optional canonical Claude runtime key. `agents.claude.binary` defaults to `claude`. You can supply an absolute path or a wrapper. `PI_FABRIC_CLAUDE_BINARY` overrides it for the current process. `/fabric settings` enumerates Claude models from that binary in the background and stores the two runner defaults independently.

The `veda` runner drives the [Veda CLI](https://github.com/kennyfrc/veda) as the child harness. `agents.veda.binary` defaults to `veda`. An absolute path or wrapper works, and `PI_FABRIC_VEDA_BINARY` overrides it for the current process. `agents.veda.backend` selects which backend Veda wraps: `agy` (Antigravity CLI, the default), `codex`, `claude-code`, `droid`, `pi`, or another backend registered by the installed Veda build. Fabric passes this value through unchanged and never hardcodes AGY. `agents.veda.model` is an optional backend-specific model or Veda alias. When you omit it, Veda selects its own backend default. `agents.veda.persona` picks the global Veda persona: `navigator-plan`, `navigator-chat` (default), `reviewer`, `worker`, or a custom persona under `~/.config/veda/personas/<name>/AGENTS.md`. Per-run selection overrides it through `agents.run({ persona })`. You can also edit the Veda backend, persona, and model in the Fabric settings panel under Agents. Each child runs one headless `veda --json` prompt with an isolated `fabric-<run-id>` session, so parallel children never share Veda selection or conversation state. Veda sessions lack persistence, and steering is unsupported. Veda children are **not** recursively Fabric-equipped (`recursive: true` is rejected), and they cannot back persistent actors.

A JS runtime launches each Fabric worker module. Fabric reuses the current runtime when `process.execPath` names `node` or `bun`. For a Bun-compiled Pi binary, `process.execPath` names the `pi` executable. Fabric then uses `PI_FABRIC_NODE_BINARY` or the first `node` or `bun` on `PATH`. The resolved runtime launches the workers. `PI_FABRIC_NODE_BINARY` overrides this choice for the current process. The Node-process executor (`executor.runtime: "node-process"`) requires Node.js because it uses `--eval` and `--input-type=module`.

Other agent settings:

- `thinking`: default reasoning effort (`off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`), default `medium`.
- `maxConcurrent`: global child concurrency semaphore.
- `maxPerExecution`: hard cap on children per `fabric_exec` invocation.
- `maxDepth`: nesting bound for child agent calls, including `rlm.query()`. It accepts any non-negative safe integer. A value of `0` disables child spawning. `/fabric settings` provides free-form numeric entry.
- `timeoutMs`: default wall-clock budget per child and the floor for per-call overrides (60 minutes by default). Fabric ignores lower per-call values. Set `timeoutMs` only to request a longer run.
- `extensions`: whether Claude children keep their normal Claude Code customizations.
- `defaultTools`: the default tool allowlist for children.
- `budgetUsd`: shared append-only cost ledger across a recursion tree (0 disables).
- `maxTokensPerChild`: cumulative token bound per child (0 disables).
- `notifyOnComplete`: send a follow-up completion message for a detached `agents.spawn()`.
- `sessionExport`: export each agent run's usage as an attributed pi-format session file (on by default).
- `sessionExportDir`: override the export store root (default `~/.pi-fabric/agent`, with `PI_FABRIC_AGENT_DIR` taking precedence).

### Usage tracking with external tools

Fabric children run with `--no-session`, so token trackers that scrape session files (tokscale, ccusage, …) cannot see subagent token usage or cost. With `sessionExport` enabled (the default), every child writes one usage-only session file (tokens and cost, never transcript content) to:

```text
~/.pi/agent/sessions/.fabric/<encoded-cwd>/<run>.jsonl
```

Fabric attributes each file through a `session_info` marker (`fabricagent-<name>`). This placement works because tokscale and ccusage walk pi's session store recursively, and pi's own resume picker reads only its immediate `<encoded-cwd>` directory. **Both trackers count Fabric subagents with zero configuration, and pi's session UI never lists these files**. The exported sessions behave like a co-hosted namespace inside pi's store.

- **tokscale**: counted under the Pi client automatically. A small dedicated-client patch (senpi-style, pointing at `~/.pi/agent/sessions/.fabric`) turns it into a separate "Pi Fabric" row with per-`fabricagent-*` attribution.
- **ccusage**: counted in the default pi footprint automatically (`ccusage daily`, `ccusage pi …`). For an ad-hoc Fabric-only view, run `ccusage pi daily --pi-path ~/.pi/agent/sessions/.fabric`.
- **Isolated store**: to keep usage files fully outside pi's store, set `agents.sessionExportDir` (or `PI_FABRIC_AGENT_DIR`) to `~/.pi-fabric/agent`, then register a ccusage named store for a dedicated `fabric` agent section:

  ```json
  { "pi": { "stores": [ { "name": "fabric", "path": "~/.pi-fabric/agent/sessions/.fabric" } ] } }
  ```

  ccusage's double-count guard rejects a named store that overlaps the default pi store, so the isolated-row form requires the separate directory.

See [agents, actors & mesh](agents.md) for the runner and transport details.

## MCP

- `mcp.disableOAuth`: when true, MCP calls can use cached credentials. New interactive OAuth flows stay disabled.
- `mcp.callTimeoutMs`: per-call timeout bound.
- `mcp.allowDynamicServers`: permit `mcp.register()` of ephemeral servers.
- `mcp.enabled`: set to `false` to disable the MCP surface.

Fabric keeps a per-project MCP descriptor cache at `.pi/fabric/mcp-cache.json`. The cache uses the same config layers as [mcporter](https://github.com/openclaw/mcporter): global settings from `~/.mcporter/mcporter.json` and project settings from `config/mcporter.json`. Tool discovery (`tools.list`/`search`/`catalog` and the capability advisory) reads these cached descriptors. Sessions reuse them while the config stays equal. Config state alone controls validity. Per-server definition hashes preserve entries when another server changes. Whitespace-only edits also keep the entries valid.

Fabric handles staleness in stale-while-revalidate style. Sessions adopt the cache instantly and re-list servers in the background per policy. When a server fails, its last-known tools stay available, marked `stale` in `mcp.$servers`. Fabric always re-lists a server the first time a call connects to it.

- `mcp.cache.enabled`: turn the descriptor cache on (default: true). When false, discovery lists tools live with a 60s in-memory TTL, matching the pre-cache behavior.
- `mcp.cache.revalidate`: background re-listing scope at session start, one of `"changed"` (only added or reconfigured servers, the default), `"all"`, or `"off"` (explicit `tools.list({ provider: "mcp", namespace })` probes still fetch exactly that server).
- `mcp.cache.revalidateBudgetMs`: wall-clock budget for one background revalidation pass (default 60000). A leftover queue tail restarts with a fresh budget.
- `mcp.advisory`: include cached MCP tools in the prompt-matched capability advisory (default: true).

See the [`mcp` reference](../skills/fabric-exec/references/mcp.md) for the call surface.

## UI

- `ui.widget` is `auto`, `always`, or `hidden`. `auto` shows active or retained Fabric runs and worker activity. Active one-shot agents and actor workers occupy rows. Their recent nested tools appear beneath them when enabled.
- `ui.showAgentToolPreview` defaults to `true` and controls the child-agent and actor tool rows in both the parent `fabric_exec` card and the widget. Recursive agents render their full descendant tree, bounded by the preview depth/node budget. The version 2 config migration renamed this key from `ui.showNestedToolCalls`.
- `ui.toolDisplay` is `"compact"` (default) or `"full"`. Compact elevates the declared display name and description and keeps bounded nested tool detail visible; full retains the outer Fabric TypeScript transcript. Pi's tool-expand keybinding (`ctrl+o` by default) expands a compact card to the full transcript and collapses it again. Invalid values fall back to `"compact"`. If configuration fails to load, rendering falls back to full so a degraded startup never hides the transcript. Change it under `/fabric settings` → **UI**; successful changes apply immediately to live and completed cards.
- `ui.updateDebounceMs` defaults to `100`. It applies one execution-wide coalescing interval to every live `fabric_exec` card update: nested calls, progress text, and agent tool previews. Continuous streams emit at most once per interval, so a long call no longer postpones every render until completion. Set it to `0` to emit every update. Accepted values clamp to `0..2000`. The version 3 config migration renamed this key from `ui.nestedToolDebounceMs`.
- The widget renders above the chat, like `pi-supervisor`. Set `ui.enabled` to `false` to disable both the widget and the dashboard controller.

See the [interface reference](interface.md).

## Mesh

Mesh data lives at `<project>/.pi/fabric/mesh` by default. Set `mesh.root` to a relative or absolute path to relocate durable topics, shared state, and actor sessions. Add `.pi/fabric/mesh/` to the project's ignore file unless you version the coordination log on purpose. Set `mesh.enabled` to `false` to disable both mesh actions and ambient actor restoration.

`mesh.actorScope` controls where persistent actor definitions, mailboxes, and child sessions are stored and restored from:

- `"project"` (default) keeps a shared actor registry at `.pi/fabric/mesh/actors/`, so actors survive `/new`. The participant directory chooses each live execution owner. Other sessions keep passive views and reload on takeover. When the creating host's lease is gone and no live owner is advertised, a later trusted session whose residency claim matches the actor (Main for `session` actors, the resident host for `durable` actors) adopts it through a fenced registry write that rebinds `rootId`. Candidacy requires the lineage root to be provably dead in the participant directory. Concurrent starters converge on one adopter through the registry lock and an `adoptedAt` fencing timestamp. A fresh adoption grants 30 seconds of grace before anyone can re-adopt the lineage, which heals adopters that die before advertising. Until some host's claim matches every shared row, create/import may still refuse with "registry is owned by another host". Durable orphans, for example, wait for a resident host. Registry writes are lock-serialized and merge only locally owned actor records.
- `"session"` isolates actors per Pi session (under `.pi/fabric/mesh/actors/<sessionId>/`). Use this scope when you run concurrent Pi sessions in one project and want each to own its own actors.

`mesh.eventContextChars` bounds the sanitized JSON context attached to each host-event activation. Fabric extracts images before it applies this bound. Redacted descriptors stand in for the images in actor mailboxes and the registry, and the actor runner receives the images out of band automatically. The configured character bound never truncates their base64.

With project scope, each actor has one lifecycle owner, and shared registry updates stay ownership-aware and lock-serialized. Mesh topics, shared state, and the participant directory are always project-scoped. Every Fabric runtime publishes one short-lived host lease along with canonical records for the roots, agents, and actors it owns. `agents.members()` and `mesh.members()` read that directory. `agents.main()` and `agents.peers()` are root projections. When a host lease expires, all of its participant records disappear from normal discovery together. `mesh.actorPollMs` sets the fallback interval for actor events and owner-addressed control commands when filesystem notifications are unavailable.

## Compaction

The deterministic, LLM-free compaction engine is on by default. It keeps Pi's bounded `keepRecentTokens` continuity tail. `compaction.targetContextRatio` sets a hard occupancy ceiling. Set `compaction.engine` to `"pi"` to restore pi-core compaction. When pi-vcc is also installed, Fabric takes precedence for automatic compaction. An explicit `/pi-vcc` command always uses pi-vcc's engine. See [compaction](compaction.md) for invariants, loss guarantees, sections, and limits.
